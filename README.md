# A naive epidemic(covid19) the possible effects of lockdown/vaccination strategies

Following a modelization on Courrier International on the positive impact of lockdowns to decrease the pace of the epidemic, i wanted to also add the impact of vaccination.
Of course, in all modelization, there is a part of subjectivity on the coefficients or weights used, etc...  <br />

Here, I wanted to model the influence of vaccination and lockdowns (all other parameters being constant), based on assumption: <br />
- Vaccinations prevent infection and contagion<br />
- move speed, directions are random


 Hence, here are the findings:<br />



A visual representation:<br />
- Red means infected, Blue means non-infected
- Triangles are the ordinary state, circle means in lockdown, squares means vaccinated
